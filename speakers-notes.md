PASS AROUND BOARD

1. Who I am.
2. Interrupt me!
3. What I know about recent embedded devices.
 * Arduino?

4. The ARM platform
 * Acorn RISC in 1980s
 * Dominant mobile platform today
 * Licensable, many manufacturers
 * Form factors
   - phones
   - set top boxes
   - crappy netbooks
   - tablets etc.
		(ask: anyone know non-ARM?)

5. The Pi
 * Brief history	| 256MB, split between cpu/grapics
 * Development woes	| Broadcom videocore, 1080p	
 * Model A vs. Model B	| Firmware on SD, hard to brick
 * Future plans		| Linuxes. Android?

boot up, show browser? network?

this is tip of iceberg, like eee.

future boxes: allwinner a10 ($70-ish)
	      VIA reference board? ($50?)
	      other random hangers-on
